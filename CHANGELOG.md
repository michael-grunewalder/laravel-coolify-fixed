# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

## [3.4.1] - 2026-07-18

### Fixed
- Cache invalidation actually works: mutations now forget the cached GET responses this package wrote (tracked in a key registry), instead of forgetting a key that was never written — the dashboard no longer serves pre-mutation state for the rest of the TTL after a deploy/restart/env change (#120)
- `Coolify` cache clearing no longer calls `Cache::flush()` — it never touches the host application's cache store (#120)
- HTTP retries are now GET-only — a timed-out deploy/restart POST can no longer fire the action multiple times (#120)

## [3.4.0] - 2026-07-18

### Added
- PHP 8.5 base images (`ghcr.io/stumason/laravel-coolify-base:8.5` / `8.5-node`); Node bumped to 24 in node images (#92)

### Security
- Generated nginx denies PHP execution under `/storage` and `/uploads` — a dropped `*.php` in an upload path can never reach php-fpm (#109)
- Generated nginx hardening: `server_tokens off`, `X-Content-Type-Options` / `X-Frame-Options` / `Referrer-Policy` on all responses including errors, and refusal of commodity scanner probes (wp-login.php, xmlrpc.php, eval-stdin.php) before they boot PHP (#115)
- Security headers repeated inside the static-asset location — nginx discards inherited `add_header` directives when a location adds its own, so cached assets (including `/storage` uploads) were missing them (#117)

**Upgrade note:** the package only generates Docker files; it never rewrites existing ones. Re-run `php artisan coolify:install` (or regenerate `docker/nginx.conf`) to pick up the nginx changes above.

### Fixed
- PHP 8.5 base image builds: switched to `install-php-extensions` and split opcache into its own layer (#100, #101)

### Changed
- CI: base image rebuilds moved from nightly to fortnightly with minimal-mode caching (#107); nightly 8.5 build and spurious automerge runs fixed (#97); claude-review workflow can now actually post reviews (#118)

### Removed
- Laravel 11 from the supported constraint range — it had been untested since the CI matrix moved to 12/13. Laravel 11 apps stay on v3.3.x.
